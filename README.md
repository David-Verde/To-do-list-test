# Awsome Books

> In this project, we design a web page that creates a list of books. You can add a new book and remove a book from the list. The list is saved dynamically on the local storage, so every time you reload the page, the data saved on the local storage is displayed on the page.


## Built With

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Linters


## Live Demo

> Coming soon.


## Getting Started

> You can download the source code and run it locally. The Live Demo is going to be available proximately.
